# Zelda3
A reimplementation of Zelda 3.

Our discord server is: https://discord.gg/AJJbJAzNNJ

## About

This is a reverse engineered clone of Zelda 3 - A Link to the Past.

It's around 70-80kLOC of C code, and reimplements all parts of the original game. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes), but with lots of speed optimizations.
Additionally, it can be configured to also run the original machine code side by side. Then the RAM state is compared after each frame, to verify that the C implementation is correct.

I got much assistance from spannerism's Zelda 3 JP disassembly and the other ones that documented loads of function names and variables.

## Additional features

A bunch of features have been added that are not supported by the original game. Some of them are:

Support for pixel shaders.

Support for enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10.

Higher quality world map.

Support for MSU audio tracks.

Secondary item slot on button X (Hold X in inventory to select).

Switching current item with L/R keys.

## How to Play:

Option 1: Launcher by RadzPrower (windows only) https://github.com/ajohns6/Zelda-3-Launcher

Option 2: Building it yourself

Visit Wiki for more info on building the project: https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki

## Installing Python & libraries on Windows (required for asset extraction steps)
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe) installer and install with "Add to PATH" checkbox checked
2. Open the command prompt
3. Type `python -m pip install --upgrade pip pillow pyyaml` and hit enter
4. Close the command prompt

## Compiling on Windows with TCC (1mb Tiny C Compiler)
1. Download the project by clicking "Code > Download ZIP" on the github page
2. Extract the ZIP to your hard drive
3. Place the USA rom named `zelda3.sfc` in the root directory.
4. Double-click `extract_assets.bat` in the main dir to create `zelda3_assets.dat` in that same dir
5. Download [TCC](https://github.com/FitzRoyX/tinycc/releases/download/tcc_20221020/tcc_20221020.zip) and extract to the "\third_party" subfolder
6. Download [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.26.3/SDL2-devel-2.26.3-VC.zip) and extract to the "\third_party" subfolder
7. Double-click `run_with_tcc.bat` in the main dir to create `zelda3.exe` in that same dir
8. Configure with `zelda3.ini` in the main dir

## Compiling on Windows with Visual Studio (4.5gb IDE and compiler)
Same Steps 1-4 above<br/>
8. Double-click `Zelda3.sln`<br/>
9. Install the **Desktop development with C++** workload with the VS Installer if you don't have it already (it should prompt you to do this).<br/>
10. Change "debug" to "release" in the top dropdown<br/>
12. Choose "build > build Zelda3" in the menu to create `zelda3.exe` in the "/bin/release" subfolder<br/>
13. Configure with `zelda3.ini` in the main dir<br/>

## Installing libraries on Linux/MacOS
1. Open a terminal
2. Install pip if not already installed
```sh
python3 -m ensurepip
```
3. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
```sh
git clone https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3
cd zelda3
```
4. Install requirements using pip
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Install SDL2
* Ubuntu/Debian `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
* Fedora Linux `sudo dnf install SDL2-devel`
* Arch Linux `sudo pacman -S sdl2`
* macOS: `brew install sdl2` (you can get homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/))

## Compiling on Linux/MacOS
1. Place your US ROM file named `zelda3.sfc` in `zelda3`
2. Compile
```sh
make
```

Advanced make usage ...
</summary>

```sh
make -j$(nproc) # run on all core
make clean all  # clear gen+obj and rebuild
CC=clang make   # specify compiler
```
</details>

## Nintendo Switch

You need [DevKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) installed.

```sh
(dkp-)pacman -S git switch-dev switch-sdl2 switch-tools
cd platform/switch
make # Add -j$(nproc) to build using all cores ( Optional )
# You can test the build directly onto the switch ( Optional )
nxlink -s zelda3.nro
```

## Building using Docker
In case you have Docker/Podman intalled you can build a docker image using the `Dockerfile` instead of using the above methods.

### Build the Docker Image

This only needs to be done one time unless the `Dockerfile` has been updated/changed

Clone this repo first

Make sure you are in the root path of this repo
```sh
docker build . -t zelda3
```

### Build the game
Ensure the rom named zelda3.sfc is in the `tables` directory

#### Build for Linux
```sh
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/zelda3 zelda3 make
```

## More Compilation Help

Look at the wiki at https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki for more help.

The ROM needs to be named `zelda3.sfc` and has to be from the US region with this exact SHA256 hash
`66871d66be19ad2c34c927d6b14cd8eb6fc3181965b6e517cb361f7316009cfb`

In case you're planning to move the executable to a different location, please include the file `zelda3_assets.dat`.

## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.

The game is run with `./zelda3` and takes an optional path to the ROM-file, which will verify for each frame that the C code matches the original behavior.
