# Zelda3
A reimplementation of Zelda 3.

## About

This is a reverse engineered clone of Zelda 3 - A Link to the Past.

It's around 70-80kLOC of C code, and reimplements all parts of the original game. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes).
Additionally, it can be configured to also run the original machine code side by side. Then the RAM state is compared after each frame, to verify that the C implementation is correct.

I got much assistance from spannierism's Zelda 3 JP disassembly and the other ones that documented loads of function names and variables.

The game also supports enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10 (see ExtendedAspectRatio in zelda3.ini). It also supports MSU higher quality music soundtracks.

## Dependencies

- the `libsdl2-dev` library
  - Windows: automatically installed with NuGet
  - Ubuntu: `apt install libsdl2-dev`
  - macOS: `brew install sdl2`
- a `tables/zelda3.sfc` US ROM file (for asset extraction step only)
  - SHA256 : `66871d66be19ad2c34c927d6b14cd8eb6fc3181965b6e517cb361f7316009cfb`. 
- The `pillow` and `pyyaml` python dependencies used by the assets extractor.
  - `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Compiling

Look at the wiki at https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki for more help.

### Windows
First extract and compile resources.

`cd tables`

Run `python3 extract_resources.py` to extract resources from the ROM into a more human readable format.

Run `python3 compile_resources.py` to produce .h files that get included by the C code.

Then build the .sln file with Visual Studio.

### Linux/macOS

```sh
make
```

```sh
make -j$(nproc) # run on all core
make clean all  # clear gen+obj and rebuild
CC=clang make   # specify compiler
```
</details>

## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.

The game is run with `./zelda3` and takes an optional path to the ROM-file, which will verify for each frame that the C code matches the original behavior.
