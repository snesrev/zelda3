# Zelda3
A reimplementation of Zelda 3.

## About

This is a reverse engineered clone of Zelda 3 - A Link to the Past.

It's around 70-80kLOC of C code, and reimplements all parts of the original game. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes).
Additionally, it can be configured to also run the original machine code side by side. Then the RAM state is compared after each frame, to verify that the C implementation is correct.

I got much assistance from spannierism's Zelda 3 JP disassembly and the other ones that documented loads of function names and variables.

## Dependencies

- the `libsdl2-dev` library (ubuntu: `apt install libsdl2-dev`, macOS: `brew install sdl2`). On Windows, it's installed automatically with NuGet.
- a `tables/zelda3.sfc` US ROM file (for asset extraction step only) with SHA256 hash `66871d66be19ad2c34c927d6b14cd8eb6fc3181965b6e517cb361f7316009cfb`. 
- The `pillow` and `pyyaml` python dependencies used by the assets extractor. `pip install pillow pyyaml`

## Compiling

`cd tables`

Run `python3 extract_resources.py` to extract resources from the ROM into a more human readable format.

Run `python3 compile_resources.py` to produce .h files that get included by the C code.


### Windows
First extract and compile resources, see above. Then build the .sln file with Visual Studio.

### Linux/macOS
#### Dependencies
Linux: `apt install libsdl2-dev`

macOS: `brew install sdl2`

#### Building
First extract and compile resources, see above. Then make sure you are in the root directory.

```
clang++ `sdl2-config --cflags` -O2 -ozelda3 *.c snes/*.c `sdl2-config --libs`
```
or
`make -j$(nproc)`

## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.

The game is run with `./zelda3` and takes an optional path to the ROM-file, which will verify for each frame that the C code matches the original behavior.

| T   | Toggle replay turbo   |
| K   | Clear all input history from current snapshot  |
| F1-F10 | Load snapshot      |
| Keypad +/- | Resize window         |
| Alt+Enter | Toggle Fullscreen     |
| Shift+F1-F10 | Save snapshot |
| Ctrl+F1-F10 | Replay the snapshot |

Additionally, there are a bunch of included playthrough snapshots that play all dungeons of the game. You access them with the digit keys. If you want to replay the stage in turbo mode, press Ctrl+Digit (eg Ctrl-5).
